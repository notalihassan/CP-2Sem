In this assignment we made diferent equations 
to find the value.
At least 10 Equations.

<!-- IMPORTANT -->

* A Double data type in C is used to store decimal numbers (numbers with floating point values) with double precision. It is used to define numeric values which hold numbers with decimal values in C.
* For Double:
    Range: 1.7E-308 to 1.7E+308
    Size: 8 bytes
    Format Specifier: %lf
* We use double instead of float in C when higher precision and a wider range of values are required for floating-point numbers.
* In this i learn about <math.h> library in C. In which we can use different things like Square root (sqrt), Power (pow) etc.
* %.2d means it gives 2 digit after decimal point.
